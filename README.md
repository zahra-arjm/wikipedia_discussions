# Conversation flow in Wikipedia Discussion Pages
Each Wikipedia page have a [talk/discussion page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages) where editors discuss how to improve a page. In some occasions, the editors have different opinions on some topics and the talk page will be tagged as "dispute" by the editors. In some cases the editors resolve the disputes on their own; in other cases the disputes are "escalated" and needs mediation from Wikipedia staff.
Wikipedia suggests its users to use hierarchy of disagreement, proposed by Paul Graham ([2008](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)) to resolve disputes constructively. Christine De Kock and Andreas Vlachos have annotated ~200 conversation from Wikipedia talk pages categorized as "dispute". They have labeled each part of the conversation (utterance) accordingly which consist of ~4000 utterance (see the full article [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08353.pdf)). Part of the labels are on the basis of Graham's proposed hierarchy of disagreement which addresses the "rebuttal tactics". Graham suggest 7 levels for disagreements starting from name-calling at the bottom (DH0) to refuting the central point (DH7). The other part of labels are called "resolution tactics" and attempts to promote 
understanding and consensus.

What we wanted to know was "what is the difference in how conversation flows in "escalated" versus "non-escalated" discussions?"
